                    <h3>Optimized Convolutional Neural Network-Based Bengali Speech Emotion Classifier</h3>
                    <p><strong>Published in:</strong> 2024 IEEE 21st India Council International Conference (INDICON)</p>
                    <p><strong>Date of Conference:</strong> 19-21 December 2024</p>
                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Speech emotion recognition (SER) is a subdomain of artificial intelligence that assists computers 
                        in comprehending user preferences and intentions. Nevertheless, the mission of SER in low-resource
                        South-Asian languages, such as Bengali, continues to be difficult due to its content varieties, 
                        dialectic changes, acoustic variability, and speakers' ages. This work proposes a convolutional 
                        neural network-based model for SER in the Bengali language using the SUBESCO dataset. 
                        The model uses the various temporal and spectral features to recognize and understand emotions 
                        conveyed through speech. The proposed work is the first attempt to introduce augmentation to the 
                        SER task. We augment the speech signals with uniform random noise, apply time stretching and 
                        shifting, and then incorporate pitch. We compile the proposed model using Adam, Nadam, RMSProp,
                        and SGD optimizers and tune it with hyperparameters, resulting in significantly higher accuracies 
                        compared to traditional machine-learning-based predictive models.
